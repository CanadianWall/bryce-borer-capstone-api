1. Install Node.JS and dependencies
2. Go to https://www.foodvisor.io/en/vision/ to get a free API key. The free key allows for 100 API calls for testing.
4. Change the "sample_env" to ".env"
5. Add the API key (I left mine in there for grading purposes).
6. That's it! run the back end with $ npm run dev
