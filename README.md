1. Install dependencies
2. Go to https://www.foodvisor.io/en/vision/ to get a free API key. The free key allows for 100 API calls per month.
4. Change the "sample_env" to ".env"
5. In the .env file, change the API key (I left mine in there for grading purposes).
6. That's it! run the back end with $ npm run dev
